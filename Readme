A simple frontend app which prints a colorscreen
Used this app to demonstrate 
1. CICD of colorscreen container by stopping, removing the previous running container and deploying new
    container with latest image from docker hub
    CHECKOUT COMMIT 50c1244b8175a5d6404bf8fe61b82bb4631a0e41
2. Making the old CICD into zero downtime CICD by implementing nginx container as reverse proxy
    and employing BLUE-GREEN DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (run a new container with alternate name(blue/green), then 
    update nginx configuration to point to new container and reload.)
    CHECKOUT COMMIT bff14b3548e81be4402124942599fe7f8b979c6f
3. Transitioned from single host single container to multiple host, multiple containers(replicas) employing
    docker swarm mode which inbuilt comes with docker engine, also implemented zero downtime deployment
    using ROLLING UPDATE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
    CHECKOUT COMMIT 32cb0edf560c31c53ee8e4e37b77aa13ebdb1484
4. Moving colorscreen to kubernetes environment
